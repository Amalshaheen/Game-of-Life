# **App Name**: Cellular Automata Explorer

## Core Features:

- Grid Rendering: Render the Game of Life grid in an HTML canvas.
- Simulation Control: Implement a set of UI buttons and associated functions, allowing the user to start, pause, step forward, or reset the simulation.
- Parameter Setting: Allow the user to set parameters like grid size and simulation speed.
- Cellular Automation: Implement logic to randomly initialize the grid state, then apply Conway's rules to generate the next state.
- State History: Add ability to record simulation state for playback, including stepping backward one frame.
- Initial Seed Painting: Initial seed can be made by painting on the screen

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#26A69A), reminiscent of early computer displays, and a modern and engaging accent color.
- Background color: Dark gray (#263238), provides contrast and focuses attention on the grid.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#B2FF59), adds vibrancy to interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface providing a clean, modern look for both body text and headings.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent actions and states.
- A clean, user-friendly layout with the grid prominently displayed.
- Smooth transitions when cells change state for clear visualization.
